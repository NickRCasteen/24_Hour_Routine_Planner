*** NOTE: "SECTION" DENOTES A BATCH OF USER STORIES WHOSE FUNCTIONS ARE INTERCONNECTED AND WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO BE BUILT BY THE SAME PERSON ***
*** NOTE: SOME USER STORIES MAY EXIST IN 2 COMPONENTS. THEY WILL BE DISTINGUISHED BY [CALL] FOR COMPONENT THAT CALLS FOR CHANGE AND [PERFORM] FOR COMPONENT
