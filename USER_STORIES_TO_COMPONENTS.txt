*** NOTE: THIS FILE IS SPLIT INTO THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS, USER STORIES DIVIDED INTO EACH ***
*** NOTE: "SECTION" DENOTES A BATCH OF USER STORIES WHOSE FUNCTIONS ARE INTERCONNECTED AND WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO BE BUILT BY THE SAME PERSON ***
*** NOTE: SOME USER STORIES MAY EXIST IN 2 COMPONENTS. THEY WILL BE DISTINGUISHED BY [CALL] FOR COMPONENT THAT CALLS FOR CHANGE AND [PERFORM] FOR COMPONENT
		THAT ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTS THAT CHANGE. SO [CALL] WILL SET PARAMETERS AND [PERFORM] WILL USE THOSE PARAMETERS IN ACTUAL CODE. ***
